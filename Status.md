# Status of Module Descriptor Files
Module Descriptor Files are either kept in the directory ```production```
for files that are complete and tested, or in the directory ```work_in_progress```
for files that still need work.
The current state of the work_in_progress files are described below.

Also check submitted [Issues](https://github.com/david284/ModuleDescriptor/issues)
to the ModuleDescriptor repository.

## Ready for Production
The following files are complete and need a final review before moving to
the production directory.
